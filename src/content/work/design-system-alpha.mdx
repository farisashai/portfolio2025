# Design System Alpha

A comprehensive case study about building a design system from the ground up.

## The Problem

Enterprise dashboards were inconsistent and difficult to maintain. We needed a unified language.

## The Solution

We built a headless component library using React and Tailwind, focusing on:

- Accessibility
- Composability
- Performance

## Outcome

Development velocity increased by 40%, and UI consistency improved across all products.
